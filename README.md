## Android Programming Task

In order to be considered for the Android position, please complete this task.

*Note: This task should take no longer than a few hours at the most.*


## Task

1. Fork this repository (if you don't know how to do that, Google is your friend)
2. Create a *source* folder to contain your code. 
3. In the *source* directory, please create an Android app that accomplishes the following:
	- Connect to the [Github API](http://developer.github.com/)
	- Find the [android/platform_build](https://github.com/android/platform_build) repository
	- Find the most recent commits (choose at least 25 or more of the commits)
	- Create a view that shows the list of recent commits by author
4. Commit and Push your code to your new repository
5. Send us a pull request (or if you prefer to keep it private, send us the files), we will review your code and get back to you


### Optional extras
Extras are appreciated. Here's a small list of ideas:
* Show avatar in the custom commit view
* Implement tapping a commit to show more details in a new view
* Load more commits when reaching the end of the list
